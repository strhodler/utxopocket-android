# UtxoPocket Documentation

This directory hosts user-facing guides you can share with the community. Everything here is safe to publish and focuses on onboarding, day-to-day usage, and lightweight troubleshooting.

## Available Guides
- [Getting Started With UtxoPocket](getting-started.md) — walkthrough for installing the app, importing descriptors, and exploring health analytics.
- [Project Setup For Contributors](project-setup.md) — instructions for developers who want to build the project locally or contribute code.

More guides (feature spotlights, release notes, FAQ) can be added here in future PRs. Internal audits, design explorations, and legacy material stay private outside this folder.
