A full node independently verifies the entire blockchain, enforcing consensus rules rather than trusting peers. Wallets connected to a full node do not rely on third parties for chain data, improving privacy and reliability. For watch‑only use, a full node enables accurate rescans and a consistent mempool view for fee estimation.
